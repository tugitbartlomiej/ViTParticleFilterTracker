# VitParticleFilterTracker

VitParticleFilterTracker is a cutting-edge project that integrates the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a Particle Filter to achieve precise object position tracking. By combining the strengths of both technologies, this system is designed to provide robust and reliable tracking even in dynamic and complex environments.

## Features

* **Vision Transformer (ViT):** Leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for superior feature extraction and object recognition.
* **Particle Filter:** Utilizes probabilistic algorithms for accurate state estimation and object tracking.
* **Robust Tracking:** Capable of handling challenging scenarios with high accuracy.
* **Modular Design:** Easy to extend and integrate with other projects or frameworks.

## Installation

To install and run VitParticleFilterTracker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VitParticleFilterTracker.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd VitParticleFilterTracker
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the project:

```
python main.py
```

## Usage

To use VitParticleFilterTracker, provide the input data (e.g., video feed or images) and configure the tracking parameters in the `config.yaml` file. The system will output the tracked positions of the objects in real-time.

## Examples

Here are some example use cases:

* **Needle Tracking:** In medical procedures, the system can track the position of a needle during insertion.
* **Object Tracking in Robotics:** Monitor and track the position of tools or objects in a robotic environment.
* **Surveillance:** Track moving objects in a surveillance feed.
